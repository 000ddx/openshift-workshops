### Install the command line tools for your operating system
The officially supported instructions for installing the oc client via Red Hat are [located here][1].  

TL;DR (using the GitHub released versions):

* Download [from here][2] and add to your PATH
* Or if you're on a Mac use [brew][3]: 'brew install openshift-cli'


### Install git 
We will use a few git commands directly in some of the advanced labs.  Please make sure git is installed on your system.  You can download the [latest version here][4].
